# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to create an account and keep a list of their favourite URLs in a shortend form (Ã  la bit.ly). This application is currently in the building phase and does not have a database at the moment. Thus, meaning that work will only be saved untill the session is terminated.
